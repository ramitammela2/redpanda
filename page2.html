Kingdom: Animalia
    Phylum: Chordata
        Class: Mammalia
             Order: Carnivora
                Suborder: Caniformia: "dog-like" carnivores
                    Family: Ailuridae (Gray, 1843)
                                  Species: Ailurus fulgens (Himalaya)
                                  Species: Ailurus styani (China)
                    Family: Canidae: coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, wolves
                    Family: Mephitidae: skunks
                    Family: Mustelidae: otters, martens, weasels, wolverines
                    Family: Odobenidae: walruses
                    Family: Otariidae: eared seals, sea lions
                    Family: Phocidae: earless seals, true seals
                    Family: Procyonidae: ringtails, coatis, raccoons
                    Family: Ursidae: bears

	Taxonomic History and Nomenclature:

		There are 2 main groups of Carnivores: dog-like carnivores ("Caniformia") and cats. How the red panda fits within the dog group is undetermined.
			Fossil evidence is scarce but suggests a close tie to the Procyonidae (raccoons).
			Molecular studies support a relationship to Mustelidae (weasels) and Mephitidae (skunks).
		2 distinct species are recognized by Colin Groves (2011); other taxonomists argue for 2 subspecies and the IUCN currently treats both as a single species – Ailurus fulgens
			A. fulgens or A. fulgens fulgens: Himalayas and perhaps Zhangmu (southwestern Tibet)
			A. styani or A. fulgens styani: Yunnan (China), Sichuan (China), Burma and perhaps eastern Tibet
		Nomenclature: In 1821, Major-General Thomas Hardwicke described the red panda in a paper presented to the Linnaean Society*. Because his paper was not published until 6 years later, he is not credited as the describer.
			"Panda" origin unclear. May derive from a local name, "nigalya ponya," which may have meant something like "bamboo footed” (Catton 1990).
			The "Giant" panda was named 48 years later because of similarities to the Red panda
			*In 1825, Cuvier published the description, choosing the name Ailurus fulgens meaning "shining" or "fire-colored" cat
		Common names:
			English: Red panda, Lesser panda, Red cat-bear, Fire fox, Fox bear, Himalayan raccoon
			Burma: Kyaung-wun
			China: Chu-chieh-liang, Xia xong mao
			Central Nepal: Hobrey
			French: Panda eclatant, Petit panda
			Spanish: Panda chico, Panda rojo

	Evolutionary History:

		 Between 30 and 50 million years ago, ancestors of modern bears (ursids) split into 2 lineages (O'Brien 1985)
			Within 10 million years of the split (possibly at the same time), the procyonid group split into Old World procyonids (lesser panda) and New World procyonids (raccoon, coati, olingo, and kinkajou)
			The Giant panda diverged from other ursids 15-25 million years ago
		Red pandas and Giant pandas ARE NOT related although they share a number of similiar characteristics (this is known as "convergent evolution")
			Both are bamboo eaters with well-developed jaws, grinding molars, and similar digestive systems
			Both have "false thumbs," which are also found in another fossil carnivore (Salesa 2011)
			Both have similar reproductive organs
			Red pandas are the only remaining member of the Ailuridae, while Giant pandas are bears (Ursidae)
		The earliest "ailurids" probably originated in Europe during Late Oligocene-Early Miocene (25-18 million years ago)
		First true Red pandas appear during the Miocene in Spain

	Cultural History:

		Earliest reference: 13th century Chou Dynasty scroll
		Because habitat is largely inaccessible, and the species is extremely secretive, it has had relatively little economic or cultural impact
		Red panda fur is considered good luck by some tribal people – Red panda fur hats are still worn in many regions, especially by bridegrooms
		The sight of a Red panda when traveling on business is considered to be a good omen
		In Central Bhutan, they are thought to be the reincarnation of Buddhist monks
		Favorite pet of Indian Prime Minister Nehru
